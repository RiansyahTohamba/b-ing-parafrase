I'll create a comprehensive linear algebra course focused on eigenvectors, with pedagogical progression from basics to advanced concepts.I've created a comprehensive linear algebra course that progresses pedagogically from basic concepts to eigenvectors! Here's what the course covers:

## Course Structure:

**Lessons 1-3**: Foundation
- Vectors and basic operations
- Matrices as linear transformations
- Visual understanding of transformations

**Lessons 4-6**: Core Eigenvector Concepts
- What eigenvectors are (special directions that only get scaled)
- Computing eigenvalues using characteristic equations
- Visualizing eigenvectors vs regular vectors

**Lessons 7-9**: Properties and Applications
- Mathematical properties (trace, determinant relationships)
- Diagonalization (A = PDP⁻¹)
- Efficient computation of matrix powers

**Lessons 10-11**: Real-World Applications
- Markov chains (weather prediction, steady states)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Lesson 12**: Practice exercises with solutions

## How to Use:

1. **Save the code** to a file like `linear_algebra_course.py`
2. **Run it**: `python linear_algebra_course.py`
3. **Study each section** - the code includes detailed explanations and visualizations
4. **Experiment** - modify the matrices and see how eigenvalues/eigenvectors change!

The course emphasizes the intuition that **eigenvectors are special directions that remain unchanged (only scaled) during transformations**, which is the key insight for understanding their importance in data science, physics, and engineering.
